            <h2>Biography of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar</h2>
            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar" id="bio-section">
                Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (Bhīmrāo Rāmjī Āmbēḍkar; 14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.

                After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s. He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.

                In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. He is also referred to by the nickname Babasaheb (BAH-bə SAH-hayb), meaning "Respected Father".

                <strong>Political Career</strong>
                Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was appointed principal of the Government Law College, Bombay, in 1935, serving for two years. He became the chairman of the governing body of Ramjas College, University of Delhi, and announced his intention to convert to another religion at the Yeola Conversion Conference in 1935, encouraging his followers to leave Hinduism. In 1936, he founded the Independent Labour Party, which won 14 seats in the 1937 Bombay election. He published "The Annihilation of Caste" in 1936 and fought against the exploitative Khoti system in Konkan, tabling a bill in the Bombay Legislative Assembly in 1937 to abolish it. As minister of labour, he served on the Defence Advisory Committee and the Viceroy's Executive Council. In 1940, he wrote "Thoughts on Pakistan" and later explained the formation of untouchables in "Who Were the Shudras?" His party transformed into the Scheduled Castes Federation, performing poorly in the 1946 elections. Elected to the Bengal Constituent Assembly, he later joined the Rajya Sabha in 1952. He lost the 1954 by-election in Bhandara and passed away before the 1957 general election.
